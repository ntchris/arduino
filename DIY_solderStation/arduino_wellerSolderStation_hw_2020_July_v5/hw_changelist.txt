V5 change list
1. 12V power detect change to D2
buzzer enable change to D6
reason: 12V power doesn't need A pin

D2 has external interrupt, so we may 
implement power loss interrupt to disable all heaters



2. more  cap for 12V Vin 
3. same resistors values
4. cap for LCD
5. 3 diodes for vin
6. remove cref because nano has it already
7. remove 12v jack, use V396 plug
8, remove switch
