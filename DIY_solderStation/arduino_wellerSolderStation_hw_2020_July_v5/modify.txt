1  zener can be removed since it's not likely 12V power loss pin can be higher than 5V, ( 75k/22k) (make sure 22k R is solder correctly to ground )
2  10V (after 3 diode) titanium capacitor 330uf not enough, maybe use other type. my 100uf -330uf is not 12V tolerant
3  Add more capacitor for 5V
4  consider add external pull up for A7 and A6(not necessary if don't care)
   (red temp purple to OpAmp to Arduino, because no internal pullup for it. (same for A6)
5  ground thermal rel made better
6 don't use arduino nano, use atmega ic and crystal. (or arduino pro mini ? )
7 dual channel PMos ?      10 smaller plane for PMos , not needed
8 other smaller OpAmp ?
9 remove all opAmp input and output Caps , tested not required.
